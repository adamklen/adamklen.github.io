    <a href="http://www.techretreat.ca" target="_blank">Tech Retreat 2015</a> was a hackathon and learning event for high schoolers with a knack for coding; it was
    held at the University of Waterloo and organized mostly by the Software Engineering class of 2019. As I wasn't in SE yet at the time of its conception, I didn't get involved with
    the project until just a couple of weeks before the event, when organizers were looking for someone with more hardware experience. As such, the organizing work
    I did was with the Hardware Learnathon, a workshop that introduced interested high school students to Arduino programming and simple electronics.

    The next two weeks were filled with lots of prep work and many late nights. I designed several introductory projects to showcase some of what the Arduino was capable
    of, including a light theremin, capacitive touch sensors, and a Simon Says game. All tutorials and sample code are available on the
    <a href="https://github.com/TechRetreat/hardware-learnathon" target="_blank">Tech Retreat Github page.</a>
    Finally, I hurriedly ordered components online and ransacked local surplus stores to prepare for the event.

    I'm happy to say that the learnathon, and the event as a whole, was very successful! In the morning, I walked the hardware learners through a couple of the project
    guides, and then floated and assisted them one-on-one in the afternoon, during which they were free to look through the remaining guides or work on their
    own projects. Some even completed impressive first-time Arduino projects (I worked closely with a pair that interfaced their two Arduinos, a keypad, and a servo motor
    to build an electronic lock) and showcased their creations along with the hackers during the demonstration period at the end of the day.

    We received an extremely positive response from both learners and hackers, and I look forward to being involved with Tech Retreat next year!
