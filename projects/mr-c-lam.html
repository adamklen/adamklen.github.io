  <h1>Mr C Lam</h1>
  <p>
    This is a reflex-testing Android game published on the
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfp.mrclam&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play Store.</a>
    Growing up playing video games was what led me to learn how to program; I've always enjoyed making games, and this gave me the
    opportunity to see what the app publishing process entailed. Work for the game was done over the course of a one week Spring break
    in 2014, including design, development, and sprite drawing.

    I see the mobile space as a platform that demands intuitive, fluid design. For simple mobile games, the experience should be such that
    the user can quickly dive in and learn how to play naturally without the need for obtrusive tutorials. In Mr C Lam, the player is tasked
    with assisting a bespectacled clam who happens upon a glorious pearl. Unfortunately, nefarious deep-sea divers are also after the pearl!
    The player taps the screen to snap the clam shut, and they have to time it to close on the divers' fingers to chase them off. Too late, and
    the diver will take the precious pearl - game over.

    To keep things interesting, the game features randomly spawning divers (up to four can be on screen at once). Their movement speed and spawn rate
    increase over time to ramp up the difficulty, and the user's local high score is persisted. For more information or to download the game,
    check out its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfp.mrclam&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play Store listing.</a>
