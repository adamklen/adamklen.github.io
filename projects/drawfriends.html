  <h1>DrawFriends</h1>
  <p>
    My first Android app, developed with a partner as my senior year CS class summative project. It's a collaborative
    drawing app that allows two users to simultaneously draw on the same canvas. It features variable stroke width and colour, and uses Bluetooth
    communication for real-time collaboration. The source code is available
    <a href="https://github.com/TheFlyingPenguin/DrawFriendsGit" target="_blank">on Github.</a>
