  <h1>Theremin</h1>
  <p>
    Although this was a rather extensive project, consuming part of a summer and many late nights afterwards, I am quite proud of the quality
    look of the finished product. As a sci-fi fan and musician, I have been interested in the Theremin for years. The opportunity to actually
    make one presented itself in the form of a senior year Physics project on electrostatic field sensors - really just an excuse to finally build one for myself!

    Initial online searches yielded few results. Most people settled for simpler, yet poorer, substitutes for the real thing - optical Theremins,
    laser harps, and the like. Not good enough for me! In time, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~rth/EMTheremin.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a> of a DIY article for a purely electromagnetic Theremin by
    Robert Moog, a very fitting mentor for this project.

    Making the Theremin also served to help familiarize me more with circuit design, as it involved building a power supply, amplifier circuit,
    and signal comparator. It was somewhat challenging to decypher the single lower-resolution schematic, as well as to deal with outdated parts
    and suppliers, but with some further research along the way, the circuitry was the first completed part of the build.

    The frame was also based on Robert Moog's design, with some modifications to accomodate my differently proportioned circuit boards. A trip to
    the hardware store yielded a hardwood board, a scrap aluminum angle, and some plumbing fixtures for use as improvised antennas. Construction
    of the body, finishing of the wood, and some final (extended) troubleshooting resulted in a surprisingly decent looking and playable musical instrument.
