    AIrena is a website for coders and AI enthusiasts. It lets users submit AI programs that participate in competitive games, with some social features like
    global ranking and optional code sharing.

    Over the course of the summer, my partner and I finished the majority of the backend framework. We designed it from the ground up to be highly
    scalable - it already has support for multiple games and programming languages, and it's not hard to add more. The website is
    very much a work in progress, and unfortunately there is still a lot of frontend work to do before there's much to show for it. I'm currently
    working on overhauling the UI and plan to reach a beta release by the end of 2015.

    The website runs on the Play framework and is written in Scala and React. Here's a sneak peak of one of the games in action, featuring two simple
    competing bots:
