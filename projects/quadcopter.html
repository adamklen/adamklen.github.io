  <h1>Quadcopter</h1>
  <p>
    This project came from a desire to learn more about control systems and mobile robotics. It began with the frame, where I was fortunate
    enough to have access to a large amount of scrap aluminum. The aluminum channel stock cross measures about 2.5 feet across - I knew I
    wanted the quad to be large and powerful enough to accommodate any future additions I might want to make to it. Sheet aluminum was used
    for the legs, battery mount, and center mounting plate.

    With the basic chassis in place, I was able to weigh it and add in the mass of other components to come up with a reasonable
    estimate of the final weight of the quad. This was followed by very extensive research and calculations on battery cell count
    and capacity, motor power and rpm, and propeller pitch and diameter. I iterated my design until I was left with an estimated range
    and dexterity that I was content with, and moved on to assembling the electronics.

    What followed was an extensive investigation into how quadcopters function and the components required for them to operate.
    Some of the things I learned about include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>
     Proper use, care, and long-term maintenance of LiPo batteries
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      The differences between brushed and brushless DC motors, and how to interface with the control circuitry required by the latter
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      How RC command signals work
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      Details behind the functionality of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, and strategies for reducing sensor noise and error
    </p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>I was eventually able to acquire all the parts I needed and mounted them on the chassis.</p>

    The final step was to program the MultiWii flight controller board with open-source Arduino code available online. Since my board
    wasn't of a supported brand, it took a fair amount of troubleshooting and delving into the code before the board was even responsive.
    This project is still a work in progress. Although the quadcopter is at a point where it can take off and perform rather short flights,
    for a better flying experience there is still more troubleshooting, calibration, and other software tweaking to be done regarding the
    sensors and PID control loop. I look forward to future projects I can do with the quad when it's completed!
