  <h1>Light Clapper</h1>
  <p>
    I wanted to do an afternoon project to spruce up my dorm room a little bit for my second term at school. The idea came to me as an application of what I
    learned about op amps in my introductory analog circuits course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inspired by the familiar old light clapper product made famous by movies and TV shows, I knew I could make one myself by using an Arduino
    and some simple logic. After a little bit of research, I picked up an analog mic, an op amp chip, and a relay, and got to work.

    First, I put together the components I needed into two simple circuits. One was a microphone amplification circuit to listen for claps,
    and the other was a relay circuit to control the lights. I also added a pushbutton so that the lights could be toggled manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tested out the microphone first, seeing what kind of values the Arduino was reading when I clapped loudly in different parts of
    the room. From this, I derived some threshold constants and coded up a state machine that could recognize an approximate double clap
    pattern (i.e. two sufficiently loud noises with silence in between in a short time span).
  </p>

    Next was the matter of toggling the lights. First, I considered building some servo mount that would let me physically toggle the
    light switch in my room (I wasn't exactly allowed to hack apart the room's lighting, after all). For simplicity's sake and to keep
    with the holiday spirit, however, I decided on hanging up Christmas lights to use with the clapper. This let me quickly modify an
    extension cord to be wired in series with a relay, giving me the flexibility to use the clapper with not just lights but any wall
    powered appliances.

    The finished project was quick & responsive and, with some tweaking of constants, quite accurate as well. See a brief video if it in action below:
