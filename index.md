This is a summary and showcase of the features I implemented for my final Introduction to Computer Graphics ray tracer project. Ray tracing is a method of rendering a digital image by sending rays of light through each pixel and simulating how they interact with a scene. As part of my project, I implemented 10 objectives (including rendering of a final scene designed by me) plus some bonus features.

##Reflection

When a ray intersects with a reflective surface, we bounce the ray off such that the incident angle to the normal is equal to the reflected angle. Certain materials may also reflect some colours more effectively than others.
