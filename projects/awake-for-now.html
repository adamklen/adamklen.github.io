  <h1>Awake For Now</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="http://devpost.com/software/awake-for-now" target="_blank">Submitted</a> to Hack Western 2015, this project came from the desire to solve a real-world
    problem that everyone on the team could relate to: waking up early in the morning. The result is a small foray into the world of IoT and home automation. Awake For Now
    is a combination Android, Arduino, and Spark Core application that automatically brews your coffee before waking you up.

    I first wrote a simple Android app that lets users set an alarm time. When it goes off, it sends a message over the network to
    the Spark Core board. This in turn communicates with the Arduino board, which activates the coffee machine, followed by a physical alarm system
    a couple of minutes later. There was still a problem, however; we recognized the issue with having an easily accessed snooze button, which
    encourages sleeping in. Instead, I wired up and programmed a simple game of skill: the user has to complete a round of Simon Says, based on a sequence
    of four flashing LEDs, before the alarm will shut off. This ensures the user has reached a state of full wakefulness, whereupon they can start their
    day right with a warm cup of fresh coffee.
