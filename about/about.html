    Through being a member and eventually an executive of my high school Computer Science club, I've developed a strong background in general CS - algorithms, data structures, and logic -
    that has given me the flexibility to explore many diverse areas of interest over the years. I've independently developed Android apps, websites, and desktop programs, built mobile robots,
    Arduino projects, and a quadcopter, and explored the fascinating worlds of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    What unifies all these interests is my excitement for the future. Today, the world is changing faster than at any other point in history; new research is being done, new technologies are
    being developed, and new products are being created that are fundamentally changing the ways we think about and interact with the world. The future is unfolding now, and I am incredibly excited to be
    a part of it - to be able to effect positive change in the world through my passion for tech.
